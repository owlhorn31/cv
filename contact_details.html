<!--
form:
form tag is used to define what goes into the form
Form doesn't do anything hence you need to put the label and input in it

label:
To write some text to display something that is a label

input:
type -
text: gives you a text box
color: gives you a color picker
submit: gives you a submit button
checkbox: gives you a checkbox
password: password input (Everything you type is masked)
email: gives you a text box that checks whether you've entered a valid email

name - helps identify the data thats inside each of these inputs

textarea:
Below will determine the starting width and height of the text area
rows: determine how tall your text area should be
columns: determine how wide your text area should be

at the bottom right corner enables you to manipulate its width

weird occurence:
When you press submit it leads you to your front page again.
This is because action (attribute of form) is assigned to the index.html


action attribute:
mailto : when pressing submit it will open your default mail client (gmail)

method attribute:
transfer what the user puts in these input field (textarea) into the email client

enctype attribute:
text/plain: encodes the data in our form as
plain text (no numbers or % signs when mail is open)
