# First lesson

# How does the Internet work?
# Its just a long piece of wire
# the wire connects different computers to each other


# server:
# some of these computers have to be online 24/7, ready to serve you all of the data and files you are requesting

# client:
# computers that access the internet


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# second lesson

In order to access a web page you need a browser.

Data that you receive from the server usually consists of three types of file:
- HTML: responsible for the structure of your website (add image, button, textbox...)
- CSS: responsible for styling your website (font, color, etc...)
- JS: that allows your website to have behaviour and do things

highlight title > right-click > inspect:
it brings up chrome developer tool
opens up the entire code file used to render the website

When you hit refresh you are making a new request to the server by loading up a fresh copy of the website

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# third lesson

All browsers are used to interpret all your code files into a website that should be displayed

HTML is required for building websites (you can create a website through just html)

HTML = HyperText Markup Language

many other markup languages:
XML = Extensible Markup Language
GML = Generalised Markup Language


you can specify layout and structure through html tags:

tags start with angular brackets and end with angular brackets
In the middle is the type of element or tag
close your tags or else the program will interpret that everything on the page should be capitalized

to close it:
backslash before the element

notice:
heading tags get smaller as the no. goes up
h6 is the smallest size for heading element!

sources for documentation:
mdn
w3 schools
dev docs

how to add spaces?
use this code br. Interesting fact is that br doesn't require a closing element!

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# fourth lesson

structure: start tag > element > end tag

there are self-closing tags which don't require an end tag, such as the break tag br

documentation:
tag omission states whether the tag is a self-closing tag or not

new tag:
hr

after the tag you can add an html attribute. Its a specification that modifies the html element further


new tag:
center: not self-closing tag

below is a boilerplate code:
Boilerplate codes are basically code templates



To get the other versions of html use code below (below is html 4)
html:4t (press tab)

Below is the latest version of html (html 5)
Tells the browser to render this file as an HTML 5 document

cheatsheet for emmet:
https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/

html tags:
indicating that everything between the tags is html code

code consists of head and body

head:
part of the html file that holds information about the webpage

title:
title of this particular document or page

meta elements:
Give extra associated data to your HTML document

Telling the browser that if we open up the file, all the text inside the webpage is encoded using the UTF-8 encoding
system

UTF-8 includes all international symbols

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Body:
contains the website content

how to structure your html file:

use indents to know which tags are contained within other ones

tags to italicize text:

i and em.

In general, it is best to use the emphasis tag because it conveys more information. The i tag just styles the
text, however the em does that too, but it says the text between it should be stressed and has importance.

tags to bold text:

bold and strong.

Strong puts emphasis

tips:
To add a new paragraph simply create a new paragraph in between the tag lines of the body
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lists:
ul: Stands for unordered list
ol: ordered list
li: Encloses each and every bullet point
How to create HTML lists
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
image:
it is a self-closing tag
provide the source of the image (it could be provided in the form of url or a local image in the same directory as your
website)

attributes:
alt: basically if browser can't render an image it would show a text instead
     This can be used

One of the issues with url is that your browser has to download it from the host website e.g. twitter (what if that host
website is down)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The H in html stands for hypertext.

Hypertext: hypertext is a bunch of text documents that can be linked together by these hyperlinks. Hyperlinks will take
you to a different text document

anchor tag:
attributes:
href: Takes you to the links destination

<a href=link destination>link text</a>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 42

Creating a table
table -> tr(table row) -> td(table data or cell or column)
thead - table head: add bold title for each of our columns -> th
tbody - table body
tfoot - table footer

In the MDN documents:
sometimes the attributes will have a thumbs down. This means that they are deprecated.
Deprecated means something that is downgraded (not recommended to use). This is because you can change the style of
your website through HTML elements and attributes (which is what CSS already does)

Tables:
Use it to affect the layout of your various html elements on your website

attributes:
cellspacing - Defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or pixels
